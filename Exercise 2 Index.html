                <h2>What is Squads</h2>
                <p>Squad is a realism-based military tactical first-person shooter video game developed and published by Canadian indie developer Offworld Industries exclusively through the Steam distribution platform.It is a spiritual successor to the Project Reality modification for Battlefield 2.</p>
                <h2>Who are we?</h2>
                <p>We are a small local group dedicated to creating a space for playing sqauds in the ways it is intended to be played with strict adherance to its core principles of teamwork, coordination, and communication. We believe in small, close-knit communities rather than large communities where you never know anyone. The community being small and tight-packed means you will always feel right at home when playing, as you play with the same squad mates as before, allowing you to improve not only yourself but your teammates through coordination and learning to cover each other weaknesses.</p>
                <h2>Are we super serious?</h2>
                <P>well thats a complex question with the answer being <b>YES</b> and <b>NO</b>, You may wonder why is that ? well because as we may be serious about the rules but most of the time we break down under game pressure and just have fun that aisde we constatly play casul matches as we belive constat competetive pressure will hurt the mental health of our team mated and consdring for each other is a very important aspect to our community</P>
                <h2>Are we new player freindly?</h2>
